# Deep BSDE Solver

This project is part of my master thesis at Imperial College, under the supervision of Panos Parpas. In this repositary, we propose a pytorch version of the work of Maziar Raissi, [Forward-Backward Stochastic Neural Networks: Deep Learning of High-dimensional Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07010.pdf). We propose several architecture to overcome the problem of stability.

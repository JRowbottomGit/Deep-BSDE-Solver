# Deep BSDE Solver

This project is part of my master thesis at Imperial College, under the supervision of Panos Parpas. We propose a deep learning approache to solve partial differential equations. 

## Architectures


_**`Full-connected`**_ 

A Pytorch version of [Forward-Backward Stochastic Neural Networks: Deep Learning of High-dimensional Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07010.pdf), a work from Maziar Raissi, is proposed. 

_**`Resnet`**_ 


_**`NAIS-Net`**_ [NAIS-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07209) were proposed to overcome the problem of forward stability in Residual Networks.
